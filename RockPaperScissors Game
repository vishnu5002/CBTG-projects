# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Explanation

## Objective:
The objective of the game is to defeat the computer by selecting a hand gesture that defeats the one chosen by the computer.

## Gameplay:
1. The game starts with a prompt inviting the player to enter their choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The player enters their choice, and the computer randomly selects one of the three options as well.
3. The choices are compared to determine the winner according to the following rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
4. The result of the round (win, lose, or draw) is displayed to the player.
5. The player is then prompted to decide whether they want to play again.
6. If the player chooses to play again, the process repeats from step 1. If not, the game ends with a message.
